I designed LSTM Mobility Models that learn trajectories of human activity trajectories that have spatial and temporal features.
The implementation of the models can be found [here](https://github.com/zihenglin/LSTM-Mobility-Model) on GitHub.

You might be familiar with LSTM models learning natural languages. At each timestamp, the LSTM model receives a word as an input and it predicts the next word in the sentence. Natural languages can be represented as word sequences and can be easily encoded using one-hot encoding. Is it possible for LSTM models to learn multidimensional spatial-temporal sequences? The answer is YES!

### What are human activity trajectories?
Human activity trajectories are sequences of stationary activities. Stationary activities refer to someone stay at a location for sometime doing something. So the stationary activities have features include, **start time**, **duration**, **location** and **purpose**.

### How does it work?

To model human like decision making for activty choices, I design the two layer model structure shown below. 
The first layer models the activity type choices, such as Home, Work, or Shopping. The second layer makes decision of
activity location and duration according to the activity type decided by the first layer.

Layer are represented as ***h***. The input to both layers ***x_t*** is the feature of previous activity. 
The softmax output from the first layer models the activity type choices. The output from the second layer is a mixture distribution that models the spatial and temporal choices.

### Examples

The `examples` directory contains Jupyter Notebook examples using artifitial data sample:

* [2 Layer Structure with Lat-Lon Location](https://github.com/zihenglin/LSTM-Mobility-Model/blob/2_layer_models/examples/Two%20Layers%20Lat%20Lng%20Location.ipynb) Model activity latitude and longitude location using Guassian mixture distributions.

* [2 Layer Structure with Location ID](https://github.com/zihenglin/LSTM-Mobility-Model/blob/2_layer_models/examples/Two%20Layers%20Categorical%20Location.ipynb) Prepocess location into location categoreis and model location categories.


### Have other type of time series problems?
The implementations of the LSTM Mobility Model provide good examples of combining discrete and multidimensionalÂ continuous features in one model. The implementations can be easily modified for your problem. Feel free to contact me if you need some extra help.
